1. Q: Find the maximum value of the function f(x) = ln ln sin(x).  
A: This task can be solved in two ways, 
Mathematical and Analytical may be more, but I will write only these two.  
Analytical -  
Mathematical -

2. Q: What is algorithm complexity?  
A-Short: O(f(n)) or Θ(f(n)  
A-Long: This is Big O function, or it is sometimes denoted by Θ.  
Ideally, the complexity of the algorithm is equal to the time 
complexity is the computational complexity that describes the 
amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.  
But how to count it???   
In reality, it depends on the input data and the processing algorithm,
also it depends on the processor architecture, the quality of transistors 
in the Logic gate, Arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and what algorithms are 
implemented in them.  
Therefore, Asymptotic analysis is mainly used. 
In fact, we define the upper bound (and lower if necessary) 
of the complexity of the algorithm using the function big O and complexity classes.
Complexity classes are typically O(n), (n log n), O(n<sup>&alpha;</sup>), O(2<sub>n</sub>), etc., where n is the input size in units of bits needed 
to represent the input.

9. Q: Can you find an even number greater than 4, that is not a sum of two
prime numbers?  
A: Funy… So you want to win a million dollrasr from … 
if I wtote you a proving of Goldbach Conjecture :D 
Now, I want to see who write this tasks :D
