            5. Bird - like a block                                      +
            6. Birds - must have base AI (***) and 
            Vector - flying direction
            int - eyes position ;) 
            1 2 3
            4 5 6
            7 8 9
                                2 - looks top
            4 - looks left      5 - looks forward       6 - looks right
                                8 - looks down

            Speed - if speed is zero - it means that a Bird in trap - it is in small cube
            Acceleration - boost - speed-up - if boost is zero - it means that in front of Bird we have a wall or barrier
            and Bird must look at up, down, left or right, and turn

            7. Stabilization system (Stabilize) - I had to make it, because the bird starts to fly upside down
